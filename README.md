# Partial JSON Parser

Sometimes we need **LLM (Large Language Models)** to produce **structural information** instead of natural language. The easiest way is to use JSON.

But before receiving the last token of response, the JSON is broken, which means you can't use `JSON.parse` to decode it. But we still want to stream the data to the user.

Here comes `partial-json`, a lightweight and customizable library for parsing partial JSON strings. Here is a [demo](https://promplate.dev/partial-json-parser).

(Note that there is [a Python implementation](https://github.com/promplate/partial-json-parser) too)

## Installation

```sh
npm i partial-json # or pnpm / bun / yarn
```

`partial-json` is implemented purely in JavaScript, and have both `commonjs` and `esm` builds.

## Usage

### Importing the library

You can import the `parse` function and the `Allow` object from the library like this:

```js
import { parse, Allow } from "partial-json";
```

The `Allow` object is just an Enum for options. It determines what types can be partial. types not included in `allow` only appears after its completion can be ensured.

### Parsing complete / partial JSON strings

The `parse` function works just like the built-in `JSON.parse` when parsing a complete JSON string:

```js
let result = parse('{"key":"value"}');
console.log(result); // Outputs: { key: 'value' }
```

You can parse a partial JSON string by passing an additional parameter to the `parse` function. This parameter is a **bitwise OR** of the constants from the `Allow` object:

(Note that you can directly import the constants you need from `partial-json`)

```js
import { parse, STR, OBJ } from "partial-json";

result = parse('{"key": "v', STR | OBJ);
console.log(result); // Outputs: { key: 'v' }
```

In this example, `Allow.STR` tells the parser that it's okay if a string is incomplete, and `Allow.OBJ` tells the parser so as an object. The parser then try to return as much data as it can.

If you don't allow partial strings, then it will not add `"key"` to the object because `"v` is not close:

```js
result = parse('{"key": "v', OBJ);
console.log(result); // Outputs: {}

result = parse('{"key": "value"', OBJ);
console.log(result); // Outputs: { key: 'value' }
```

Similarity, you can parse partial arrays or even partial special values if you allow it:

(Note that `allow` defaults to `Allow.ALL`)

```js
result = parse('[ {"key1": "value1", "key2": [ "value2');
console.log(result); // Outputs: [ { key1: 'value1', key2: [ 'value2' ] } ]

result = parse("-Inf");
console.log(result); // Outputs: -Infinity
```

### Handling malformed JSON

If the JSON string is malformed, the `parse` function will throw an error:

```js
parse("wrong"); // MalformedJSON [Error]: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'w', "wrong" is not valid JSON at position 0
```

## API Reference

### parse(jsonString, [allowPartial])

- `jsonString` `<string>`: The JSON string to parse.
- `allowPartial` `<number>`: Specify what kind of partialness is allowed during JSON parsing (default: `Allow.ALL`).

Returns the parsed JavaScript value.

### Allow

An object that specifies what kind of partialness is allowed during JSON parsing. It has the following properties:

- `STR`: Allow partial string.
- `NUM`: Allow partial number.
- `ARR`: Allow partial array.
- `OBJ`: Allow partial object.
- `NULL`: Allow partial null.
- `BOOL`: Allow partial boolean.
- `NAN`: Allow partial NaN.
- `INFINITY`: Allow partial Infinity.
- `_INFINITY`: Allow partial -Infinity.
- `INF`: Allow both partial Infinity and -Infinity.
- `SPECIAL`: Allow all special values.
- `ATOM`: Allow all atomic values.
- `COLLECTION`: Allow all collection values.
- `ALL`: Allow all values.
- `OUTERMOST_OBJ`: Allow partial parsing of the outermost object.
- `OUTERMOST_ARR`: Allow partial parsing of the outermost array.

#### OUTERMOST_OBJ and OUTERMOST_ARR

These new allowances provide more granular control over parsing partial JSON:

- `OUTERMOST_OBJ`: Allows partial parsing of the outermost object in the JSON hierarchy, even if `OBJ` is not allowed.
- `OUTERMOST_ARR`: Allows partial parsing of the outermost array in the JSON hierarchy, even if `ARR` is not allowed.

The "outermost" object or array doesn't necessarily mean the root of the JSON. It refers to the highest-level object or array in the current parsing context, which doesn't have another object or array above it in the JSON hierarchy.

These allowances are particularly useful when you want to parse partial data at the highest level of your JSON structure while maintaining stricter parsing for nested objects or arrays.

For examples of how to use these allowances, please refer to the test cases in the project repository.

These new allowances provide more fine-grained control over partial JSON parsing, especially useful in scenarios where you want to be more permissive with top-level structures while maintaining stricter parsing for nested elements.

## Testing

To run the tests for this library, you should clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/promplate/partial-json-parser-js.git
cd partial-json-parser-js
npm i
```

Then, you can run the tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/):

```sh
npm run test
```

Please note that while we strive to cover as many edge cases as possible, it's always possible that some cases might not be covered.
